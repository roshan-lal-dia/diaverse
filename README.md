# DIAverse - We're not apart in DIAverse

A series of websites that I built by tinkering with templates and learnt web programming while doing so, it's the beginning of DIAverse

- This canon event happened during the lockdown period after my High school exams have been completed and I was enrolled in an engineering college.
- I skipped remote classed and built thid brand without thinking of scaling or learning programming, just did it
